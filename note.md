## Python Basics

### Knowledge

* declarative knowledge: Statements of fact
* imperative knowledge: recipe (**More value**)

### Machines

#### Fixed program computer (Finish specific task)

* Calculator
* Alan Turingâ€˜s Bombe

#### Stored Program Computer 

Machine stores and executes instructions.

* Sequence of instructions stored inside computer built from predefined set of primitive instructions
  * arithmetic and logic
  * simple tests
  * moving data
* special program(interpreter) execute each instruction in order
  * use tests to change flow of control through sequence
  * stop when done

##### Basic Machine architecture:

#### Basic Primitives

Turing Machine: compute anything with six primitives.

move left, move right, scan, print, write, do nothing.

**abstract methods to create new primitives**



> Q: What does it mean when we say that "the computer walks through the sequence executing some computation"?
>
> A: **The computer executes the instructions mostly in a linear sequence, except sometimes it jumps to a different place in the sequence.**
